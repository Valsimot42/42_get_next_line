<h3><b>¤ Introduction ¤</b></h3>

<p align="center"> In "get_next_line", we learn about an important concept of C programming: static variables. The task of this project is to create a program which will take in
"buffer_size" of characters which it took from the read line. If it encounters a "newline character", we should move to the next line. Aside from static variables, "get_next_line" also offers
a peek in other C language concepts which you will find out on your own.</p>
